# lets-build-express

This series of chapters will teach you how to create the `express` library from scratch. This will help us understand how `express` actually works, behind the scenes.  I will use the same code, variable names, and so forth from `express` itself, so that people can read this tutorial and feel free to contribute to `express` directly.

# Why?
I find people do often get confused with how `next` works, or how route order works in `express`. By building the `express` library, we can gain a more solid understanding.  Also, it's fun! 

Each chapter will build `express` step by step with running examples.

Here is the TOC:

1. [Chapter 01 -- Building Express Abstractions](https://github.com/antoaravinth/lets-build-express/blob/master/chap01/CHAP01.md)
2. [Chapter 02 -- Handling routes out of the box](https://github.com/antoaravinth/lets-build-express/blob/master/chap02/CHAP02.md)
3. [Chapter 03 -- Implement `next` function](https://github.com/antoaravinth/lets-build-express/blob/master/chap03/CHAP03.md)
4. [Chapter 04 -- Extending Response Object](https://github.com/antoaravinth/lets-build-express/blob/master/chap04/CHAP04.md)
5. [Chapter 05 -- Implementing `send`/`json` on `response`]((https://github.com/antoaravinth/lets-build-express/blob/master/chap05/CHAP05.md))
6. Chapter 06 -- Error Handling (WIP)
7. More to come.

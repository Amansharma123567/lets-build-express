# lets-build-express

This series of chapters going to teach you, how to create a express library from the scratch. This will help us understand how express actually works behind the scenes. Note that, I will literally use the same code / variable name etc from the express source itself, so that people can read this tutorial and feel free to contribute to express itself.

# Why?
Well, I find people do often get confused with how `next` works, or even how route order works in express. By building the express library itself, I guess we can gain a very solid undestanding. Also its fun! 

Each chapter will build express step by step with running example. 

Here are the TOC:
